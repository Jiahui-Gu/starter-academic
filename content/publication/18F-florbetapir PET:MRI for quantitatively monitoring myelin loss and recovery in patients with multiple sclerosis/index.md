abstract: From March 2019 to September 2020, twenty-three patients with MS and nine healthy controls (HCs) underwent a hybrid PET/MRI at baseline and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) assessment, and eight of 23 patients further underwent follow-up PET/MRI. The distribution volume ratio (DVR) and standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of 18F-florbetapir in damaged white matter (DWM) and normalappearance white matter (NAWM) were obtained from dynamic and static PET acquisition. Diffusion tensor imaging-derived parameters were also calculated. Data were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation with 99% confidence interval (99%CI).

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In summary, with a longer half-life than 11C-PiB, 18F-florbetapir PET was a very promising tool for quantitatively monitoring myelin loss and recovery in patients with MS. Hybrid 18F-florbetapir PET/MRI could synchronously provide information on the myelin content change and microstructure change of WM tracts in DWM lesions and NAWM of patients with MS, and will become a powerful technique for evaluating the efficacy of remyelination-targeted drugs in the future.
